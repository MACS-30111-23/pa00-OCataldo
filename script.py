## Summary/Reflection
This was my first experience using any type of software/program so I relied a lot on articles and youtube videos. I was able to figure out the simpler things such as how to make a title larger to changing the name display of my URL. It was really exciting for me because the whole process was new but I got to break it down by section and tackle it one problem at a time!
